The Site is a study community experience connected to the creator’s Study With Me streams, including a status/dashboard, optional Study Room access, study plan and records pages, and an FAQ/contact form.

3) Eligibility
You must be at least 16 years old to create an account and use account-based features.

4) Accounts and profile
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.
Your @handle (username) is unique and may be non-editable after registration.
You must not impersonate others, mislead users about your identity, or attempt to access areas you are not authorized to access.

5) Community rules
You agree not to post or submit content that is spam, abusive, hateful, harassing, threatening, illegal, or that violates others’ rights.
You agree not to share private information about yourself or others (phone numbers, addresses, passwords, IDs).
You agree not to attempt to bypass security controls or disrupt the Service.
Focus culture: during focus sessions, keep chat minimal and respect the quiet study environment.

6) User content (FAQ questions, profile content)
You keep ownership of content you submit.
If you choose “OK to publish in FAQ”, you grant the Site a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to store, display, and publish your question (and our answer) within the Service.
We may reject, remove, or edit content for clarity (without changing meaning) and to enforce rules.

7) Moderation and enforcement
We may remove content, restrict features, or suspend/terminate accounts if you violate these Terms or if we reasonably believe it is necessary to protect the community or the Service.

8) Study records, streaks, badges
Study metrics and records are provided “as is” and may be delayed or inaccurate due to technical reasons. We do not guarantee perfect tracking.

9) Third-party services
The Site may link to or embed third-party services (for example YouTube and KakaoTalk). Your use of those services is governed by their own terms and policies.

10) Disclaimers
The Site and streams are personal documentation and a study space. We do not provide official teaching, legal advice, medical advice, or professional services.
